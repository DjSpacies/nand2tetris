This is the first Python code I ever wrote, it may not be pretty but it works for what I need it to.
Included is an assembler which will convert symbolic 'Hack' assembly language into machine code 1's and 0's
Also some basic programs written in Hack assembly code which can be parsed by the assembler and converted into machine code.
