This is the first Python code I ever wrote, it may not be pretty but it works for what I need it to.
Included is an assembler which will convert symbolic 'Hack' assembly language into machine code 1's and 0's

The second script is a compiler which will compile a higher level 'Jack' programming language into 'Hack' assembly instructional code.
